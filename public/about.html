<h1>About Me</h1>
<P>Hey, I’m Tazkeer Khan. I like to keep things simple but also think a lot about life, tech, and business. I enjoy good conversations, whether it’s something deep or just random fun. I don’t talk too much, but when I do, I make sure it makes sense.</p>  

  <p>I like learning new things, improving myself, and helping people when I can. I think a lot before I say something, and I like making things clear. I don’t overcomplicate stuff but also don’t like things being too basic.</p> 
  
  <p>I believe in honesty, real connections, and just going with the flow. If something interests me, I give it my full attention. If someone needs support, I listen. That’s just who I am.</P>
